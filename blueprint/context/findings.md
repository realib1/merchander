### F-13 [P2] open - Platform overview fetches whole tables on every page load

**File:** src/app/actions/platform.ts:88
**Found:** 2026-09-03 by /audit (scope: full; lens: performance)
**Why it matters:** `getPlatformOverviewData` selects every row of `orders`,
`products`, `tenant_users`, `channel_connections`, `tenant_subscriptions`, and
`tenant_settings` including the full `settings_data` jsonb, then joins in memory.
It runs on `/platform`, `/platform/merchants`, and again inside
`getPlatformRevenueMetricsAction`, all `force-dynamic`, so nothing is cached.
`auth.admin.listUsers({ perPage: 1000 })` is a hard cap: past 1000 users, tenant
owner emails silently go missing. `coding-standards.md` calls for an RPC or view
once an aggregation fans out this far.
**Suggested fix:** Move the counts and sums into a Postgres RPC returning one
aggregate row, and page or drop `listUsers` in favour of a targeted lookup.
**Resolution:**
